      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>On January 15, 1908, 16 young college women started Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. at Howard University in Washington, DC. Established to encourage high ethical and moral standards, create lifelong friendships, be a network of support for college women of equal talent and strength, and most importantly, to be of service to all mankind. More than a century later, led by the spirit of the founders, we continue on that path. Nine juniors and seniors initiated the group and invited 7 sophomores to join them. Together, they created the mission, colors, symbols of recognitions and purpose that all members hold near and dear to their hearts.</p>
